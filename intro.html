    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Weibo Lin. I'm originally from China and currently a high school student in Canada. I've always been passionate about computer science and game design. These interests have motivated me to keep learning programming in my spare time.</p>
    <p>While studying programming, I also enjoy taking on different challenges. Since moving to Canada, I have participated in the Waterloo Mathematics Contest every year. I've also competed in the CyberPatriot cybersecurity competition, gaining hands-on experience in system protection.</p>
    <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy playing badminton and skiing. These activities have taught me the value of perseverance and discipline.</p>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>I'm deeply interested in computer science, game development, and artificial intelligence. I'm currently taking Harvard's CS50 course series, which includes computer science, Python programming, web development, and AI. At the same time, I'm also learning more about Unity and C# to improve my game development skills.</p>
    <p>My ultimate goal is to apply to the Computer Science program at the University of Toronto, St. George campus, and pursue a career in either game development or AI. I hope to combine my programming skills with creativity to build games that are both fun and meaningfulâ€”and perhaps even develop intelligent systems in the future.</p>

    <h2>My Skills</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> I'm still learning, but I'm confident that I'll master many more as I continue to study.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> I've studied game design, level design, narrative design, and story writing. I work with Unity 2D and C#, and I can create small indie games.</li>
        <li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> I've gained hands-on experience in system defense through the CyberPatriot competition. I also know how to use Linux commands and write Bash scripts.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> I'm familiar with HTML and CSS, and I'm currently working to improve my skills in this area.</li>
    </ul>
