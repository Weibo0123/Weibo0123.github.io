    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Project Overview:</h3>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;">
        Not Home Anymore is a text-based survival game about environmental collapse and resilience.<br>
        Set in a scorched farm and the edge of a dying forest, players explore, uncover signs of ecological damage, and make slow, knowledge-driven choices to try to restore the land.<br>
        Built in Twine, this project focuses on atmosphere, meaningful consequences, and the quiet challenge of rebuilding life after everything has changed.
